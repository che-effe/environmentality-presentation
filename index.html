						<h2>environmentality</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p> I came up with the concept foran app that I call Environmentality
								to help motivate people to do something
								simple, and something great.
							</p>

							<p>After doing some extensive research into why some similar programs have little or
								no success, I’ve determined what the problem is.
							</p>

							<p> I needed to find a way NOT to make people help clean up, but make them want to
								clean up.
							</p>

							<p>because; It's not easy to do something decent, in a world that doesn't always reward decency.
								So,Let's start rewarding people for decency. And give them a reason to do the right thing.
							</p>
							<small> Start presenting the app from iphone </small>
							<small> Then show the about page with potential reward partners  </small>

							So when I started creating this app, I knew that I wanted a simple app
							that engeged people in a way that would help the environment. But I needed to keep
							their attention.
							So I incorporated a gamification system into my plans.
						</p>
						<p>
							Neil suggested that I read "For the Win". It's a great book that touches on a lot
							of the psychology of motivation through game. The knowledge that I gained from reading
							it really helped when I was trying to create a system to keep players motivated.
							It's going to continue to be a guide as I iterate on this app in the future.

							I highly recommend the book, it's a quick read and it was really interesting.

						The key for the success of this project ended up being a moment when
						I realized that complexity in the functionality would detract from the
						maintainability of the effectiveness and adoption of the app by users.

							<li> quizes</li>
							<li> scavenger hunts</li>
							<li> etc</li>

						<h1>My Process</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Settling on an Idea</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p> I had a few ideas of what I wanted to work on for my synthesis
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Dog trainer</li>
								<li>posture tracker</li>
							</ul>
							<p> I decided on focusing on the Chesapeake Bay project because
								it was something that I felt I could get more emotionally
								involved in and have more succsess with.
							</p>

						<h2>Creating an Identity</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p> This app had to have a catchy name and brand that helped to drive home
								the mission I was trying to create.
								"To change peoples’ bad habits that negatively impact the environment.
								To encourage participation in a fun and engaging way"
							</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>

						<h2>The Logo and Icon</h2>
						<img class="logo" src="assets/images/logo-breakdown.png"/>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p> I had a great deal of fun coming up with the logo.
							</p>
							<p> At first glance it looks like a tree. But it's got a lot more than that going on.
								  it is also a brain with neurons, a lilly pad, and a representation of a river
									system with many far reaching tributaries.
									This helps to drive the mission being that it has
									elements that signify a message about the environment, and it's connection
									to our brain, and how we percieve and choose to interact with our environment.
							</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>

						<h2>A Schedule</h2>
						<img class="logo" src="assets/images/schedule.gif"/>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>After I created the identity, I needed to plan ahead to make sure I kept my eye on the deadline
							</p>
							<p>Making this production schedule allowed me to make certain decisions about what I could keep
								in for the first iteration of the app, and what could come later. It was crucial to
								get me to the point where I could determine the MVP for the first go around.
							</p>

						<h2>Designing the interface</h2>
					</section>
					<section data-background="assets/images/wireframes.png">
						<h2>Wireframes</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Creating the wireframes was a crucial step in my process</p>
							<p>I used printouts to do paper prototyping to test that the placement
							of elements withing the application were logical to a user.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section data-background="assets/images/mockups.png">
						<h2>Mockups</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Designing a styleguide and using that to breathe life into the wireframes
							made the application start to become a reality for me. I could suddnly see the
							application that i had been imaginging beginning to take it's form.</p>

							</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Designing and developing the application</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>The first step in actually building the application was finding the
							right tools.</p>
							</aside>
					</section>
					<section>

						<h2>The right tools for the job</h2>
						<img class="logo" src="assets/images/ruby-on-rails-logo.png"/>
						<img class="logo" src="assets/images/AmazonS3.png"/>
						<img class="logo" src="assets/images/Heroku_logo.png"/>
						<img class="logo" width="300px" src="assets/images/gitlogo.png"/>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>I needed to do some research on what technologies would be available that
								would best suit my needs for developing the app.
							</p>
							<p>I decided to use Ruby on rails, even though I had no experience with it.
							</p>
							<p>I had to deal with a learning curve at the beginning but it proved to be the best
								tool for the job.
							</p>
							<p>For secure, bulk storage of image files, I used Amazon s3 which proved to be an easy
								to implement tool to store a large amount of images securely.
							</p>
							<p>For hosting and deployment of the application, I choose Heroku. Heroku also holds onto
								my Postgresql database. Deploying builds of the application through heroku has been
								very reliable, though it can start to get expensive when you start scaling things up.
								I may have to find a different deployment strategy in the near future, but it has been great
								for getting the app off the ground.
							</p>
							<p>For versioning control and deployments through heroku, I used Git, which has proven
								to be an invaluable tool, and I feel should really be taught in the program though it is not.
							</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>the applications foundations</h2>
						<h1 style="font-weight:600" class="fragment">10 different technologies!</h1>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Most of the logic for creating users, sessions and most everything else pertaining
								to the database and flow of the application were handled by using ruby</p>
							<p>All of the views of the application are written in erb, which is a ruby templating
							language that builds the final html that the server delivers to the client.</p>
							<p>All of my styling was written in css. and there was some lower level logic that
							I handled in Javascript.</p>
							<p>In the end, I ended up using somewhere around 10 different technologies to build
								the application</p>
